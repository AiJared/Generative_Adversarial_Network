## Image Generation with Generative Adversarial Network

### Architecture:

We've created a **custom GAN** with a **generator** and **discriminator network**.
The generator takes *random noise* and generates images.
The discriminator attempts to distinguish between **real** and **generated** images.


### Key Components:
 - **build_generator()**: Creates a neural network that generates images from noise.
 - **build_discriminator()**: Creates a neural network that classifies images as real or fake.
 - **train_step()**: Implements the core GAN training logic with gradient computation.
 - **preprocess_images()**: Helps load and preprocess your custom dataset.


### Training Process:

The **generator** tries to create *realistic images*.
The **discriminator** tries to correctly identify *real vs. generated images*.
Both networks improve through **adversarial training**.



### Requirements:

 1. TensorFlow
 2. NumPy
 3. Matplotlib
 4. A directory of training images

## How to Use:

Replace 'path/to/your/image/directory' with the path to your image dataset.
Ensure images are in .png, .jpg, or .jpeg format.
Images will be automatically resized to 64x64 pixels.

## Notes:

This is a basic implementation. Advanced GANs like **DCGAN** or **StyleGAN** have more complex architectures.
Training requires a GPU for reasonable performance.
The quality of generated images depends on your training dataset.
